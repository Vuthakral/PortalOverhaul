# Q&A/FAQ:

"I found content in here from other users stuff on GameBanana, You dirty modders ae stealing content!"
The actuality is, they are being used ace placeholder assets, as we are striving for a Portal 2 art style with this mod, and others have directly ported Portal 2 content before. They will be removed & replaced later on.

"Should I worry about any hardware requirements?"
Probably not, Those of us who test it on 5-year-old graphics cards still get source's default capped fps of 300. As long as you can run Portal 1, you should be able to run this decently fine.
